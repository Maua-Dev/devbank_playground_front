The main objective of this project is to provide an interactive and educational platform that facilitates practical learning about API creation. 

The project aims to encourage collaboration and knowledge exchange among community members, creating an environment where developers can learn, share experiences, and improve their API development skills. 

The idea behind the project is to simulate a real bank application, where the user can make deposits, withdrawals, and access transaction history through API requests.
