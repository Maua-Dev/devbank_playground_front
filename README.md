# üí≤devbank_playground_front


The main objective of this project is to provide an interactive and educational platform that facilitates practical learning about API creation. 

The project aims to encourage collaboration and knowledge exchange among community members, creating an environment where developers can learn, share experiences, and improve their API development skills. 

The idea behind the project is to simulate a real bank application, where the user can make deposits, withdrawals, and access transaction history through API requests.

## ‚úçÔ∏è Scripts
To run the application, it's important to use a package manager tool such as yarn or npm.

###### start
    npm run start
    yarn start

Runs the app in the development mode. 
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser. 
The page will reload when you make changes.

###### test
    npm run test
    yarn test

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

###### build
    npm run build
    yarn build

Builds the app for production to the build folder.

###### eject
    npm run eject
    yarn eject

Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back! 
This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
